To reformat the raw data for uploading into a database, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new table in your database with the desired column names and data types.
2. Map the raw data to the corresponding columns in the new table.
3. Parse the raw data and insert it into the new table.
4. Clean and transform the data as needed for database compatibility (e.g., convert data types, remove duplicates, etc.).
5. Verify the data integrity and consistency by running queries and performing checks.
6. Optimize the table structure and indexes for efficient data retrieval and storage.
7. Set up appropriate access controls and permissions for the new table.
8. Test the data upload and retrieval processes to ensure they are working correctly.

Remember to backup your database before making any changes to avoid losing any data.
